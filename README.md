# DAC
INTERFACING DAC WITH 8086 KIT AND GENERATING SAWTOOTH AND SQUARE WAVEFORMS
AIM
To write an assembly language program in 8086 to generate Sawtooth and Square waveforms using DAC.

APPARATUS REQUIRED
S. No	Item	Specification	Quantity
1	Microprocessor kit	8086	1
2	Power Supply	+5 V DC, +12 V DC	1
3	DAC Interface board	-	1
ALGORITHM
Measurement of Analog Voltage
Send the digital value to DAC.
Read the corresponding analog value at its output.
Waveform Generation
Square Waveform
Send low value (00) to the DAC.
Introduce suitable delay.
Send high value to DAC.
Introduce delay.
Repeat the above procedure.
Sawtooth Waveform
Load low value (00) to accumulator.
Send this value to DAC.
Increment the accumulator.
Repeat step (ii) and (iii) until accumulator value reaches FF.
Repeat the above procedure from step 1.
